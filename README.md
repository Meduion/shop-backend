  ## Installation
  
  The database needs to be created by using a mySQL program such as mySQL workbench. Create the database using the provided schema. Once the db exists use node seeds/index.js to seed the database with initial data. After that run the server with node server.js to host the server locally. Insomnia can then be used to interact with the db.
